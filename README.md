# Purpose

These are some ansible scripts that I use to configure my Ubuntu 18.04 workstation.

I got tired of running in circles and figuring out the missing pieces in my standard setup time and time again.

# Usage

Just run `make` this will install a version of ansible from the official Ubuntu sources (if that's necessary), and execute the playbooks afterwards.

# Project Structure

The project structure attempts to follow the best practices described in [the ansible user guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html)
